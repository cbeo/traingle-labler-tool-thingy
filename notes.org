* Once started   

  Here are the main commands

p (switch-mode :path)
T (switch-mode :triangle)
t (switch-mode :tracking)
s (switch-mode :select)
n (cycle-models)
N (cycle-models t)
Z (cancel)
up (move-selected 0 -5)
down (move-selected 0 5)
left (move-selected -5 0)
right (move-selected 5 0)
tab (next-selected-point)
l (label-model)
X (export-model)

In path mode, points are added to the current path in response to clicks

In tracking mode, poitns are added to the current tracking points

In triangle mode, the mouse is used to click on any three points, a
triangle is then added to the model's triangles

in select mode, you can select a triangle by clicking

Tab cycles through triangles. As points are cycled through, they are
printe to the terminal, and are highlted in the display window

Some repl commands:

(begin-edit-loop) will cycle through all poitns, allowing you to edit
them, taking input from the repl

(edit-selected) will let you edit the currently selected point
